\begin{abstract}
With the rapid expansion of digital music libraries and streaming platforms, providing personalized and relevant music recommendations has become essential for enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. This project aims to develop a music recommendation system that uses  content-based filtering to offer accurate, diverse, and personalized song suggestions. By leveraging advanced audio feature extraction from tracks, the system seeks to address challenges such as the cold-start problem, data sparsity, and the balance between familiar and novel recommendations. In this project, we collect and process song metadata, and audio features to train various machine learning models, including similarity-based methods for content filtering. Additionally, we extract musical characteristics such as tempo, key, and spectral features from audio files to enrich the recommendation process.

\section{Introduction}



\subsection{Background}


Music recommendation systems have become a fundamental part of digital music streaming platforms, significantly transforming how people discover and listen to music. Modern music recommendation systems have evolved to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to provide personalized listening experiences. These systems predominantly rely on two main approaches: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

Collaborative filtering focuses on analyzing user interactions and finding patterns in their behavior to suggest tracks that similar users have enjoyed. This technique has proven effective in uncovering user preferences without needing explicit information about the songs themselves. On the other hand, content-based filtering utilizes the features of the songs, such as tempo, key, genre, lyrics, and rhythm, to recommend tracks that share similar characteristics to what a user has already liked.

In this project, by extracting and analyzing deeper musical characteristics directly from audio tracks, we intend to enhance the personalization of recommendations and improve user satisfaction in music exploration.


\subsection{Motivation}

The abundance of available music can make it hard to find new favorite songs. Most music recommendation systems recommend songs based on what similar people listened to. This can prevent users from finding new music that might not be as popular. We plan to solve this issue by creating a recommendation system based on the music itself. Those who tend to like certain songs should like ones similar to them. 

Another thing is that our system would be able to recommend music that is very different from what our user is used to. This recommendation system would not only prevent the monopoly of certain artists or songs being popular but would also allow users to expand their horizon as they can explore genres that they may have never considered before. Our system in conclusion is focusing solely on the user and their music, creating a more personalized recommendation than current systems. By capturing nuances in music features, we are able to recommend songs that might otherwise be missed by the user. 



\subsection{Challenges}
% The model's predictions will have to be based on similar music or very different music. A computer can not predict what a human is thinking. Therefore,


% Humans sometimes like new things which could confuse the model
% Some people listen to different genres depending on their mood
% Discovering new music versus recommending similar music
% Music taste changes over time
% Some genres or people might have little data on them
% Music datasets for platforms are huge 
% Modelâ€™s ability to predict songs outside the data
% Music can be subjective

{\bf Cold-Start Problem:} The model could have difficulty recommending items to new users with no history or new items with no user interactions. While collaborative filtering excels at suggesting popular tracks, it may not be as effective at introducing users to lesser-known songs or genres they might enjoy. Content-based systems, while better at personalizing, can sometimes limit the variety of recommendations, leading to repetitive listening experiences. If the audio features do not have a direct correlation with the genres and similarities of the songs, it would be hard to assess whether it is worth using them as features. 

{\bf Scalability:} Music streaming platforms handle massive amounts of data from millions of users and songs, requiring recommendation algorithms to be highly scalable. Ensuring that the system can make real-time recommendations for a growing user base without compromising performance is a technical challenge. It would also be a challenge to provide recommendations for songs that do not currently exist in the database. We would need to incorporate methods to extract audio features real time and make predictions based on that, which might be a long process. 

\section{Related work}
\label{gen_inst}

% A lot of music platforms recommend music already: Youtube, Spotify, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc.
% Rely on user listening history and user interaction instead of music analysis
% Some of these platforms have challenges with their music data to make recommendation systems such as Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge
% Genre classification has been done before but accuracy is a challenge

Numerous music recommendation systems have been proposed, often relying heavily on user interaction data. While these systems can provide personalized recommendations for established users, they face limitations such as the cold-start problem and the challenge of recommending diverse and unexpected music.

To address these limitations, researchers have explored various techniques, including content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches. Content-based filtering recommends items based on their similarity in features, while collaborative filtering leverages user-item interactions. Hybrid approaches combine these techniques to improve recommendation accuracy. Deep learning models, such as neural networks and transformers, have been employed to capture complex patterns in user behavior and music features.

Additionally, research by Budhrani et al. [2], Elbir and Aydin [3], and Adiyansyah et al. [5] has demonstrated the effectiveness of music embeddings in capturing the inherent characteristics of songs. Genre classification techniques, as explored in [4], [7], and [12], can improve recommendation accuracy. Hybrid approaches, as suggested in [8] and [9], can leverage the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering. To address the challenges of cold start and data sparsity, techniques like personalized exploration strategies and diversification algorithms, as discussed in [6], can be employed.

By incorporating these techniques and addressing the limitations of existing approaches, we aim to develop a robust and effective music recommendation system that provides personalized and engaging listening experiences.

\section{Methodology}
\label{headings}
{\bf Proposed framework}

{\bf Data Collection:} We plan to collect raw audio tracks from existing YouTube playlists that have been organized by genre, utilizing web scraping technologies such as the yt-dlp python library. We will visualize a subset of the data features to understand how the audio features are related to each other, and how they look in different genres. We will conduct a principal component analysis, plot frequency vs time, amplitude vs time graphs. We will extract the features such as tempo, harmony, etc. from each audio track, storing it in a separate file using the python library Librosa, which extracts such features from raw tracks.
The genre labels are encoded using LabelEncoder and the features are normalized using StandardScaler. 

{\bf Predictions:} We will use the extracted audio feature data to train machine learning models and test the accuracy of genre predictions. This will help us investigate how the audio features correspond to the genres. We will train and test multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance. 
For example for the neural network, we use a linear activation function with mse as the loss function and Adam optimizer. We use randomized grid search to find the best model hyperparameters to train it on the features of the songs in the dataset. 
Our overall workflow is: when a user inputs a song, the model predicts the features of the song using a trained model, calculates the similarity indices of the songs in the dataset using cosine similarity to the inputted song, and recommends the most similar songs. 

The proposed music recommendation system leverages a combination of techniques to provide recommendations:

\subsection*{Training Input (for the Neural Network Model)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The input to the model consists of the numerical features of songs extracted from the dataset (e.g., tempo, rhythm, loudness, etc.).
\item \textbf{Shape:} \((\text{num\_samples}, \text{num\_features})\), where \(\text{num\_features}\) is the number of numeric audio features in the dataset.
\item \textbf{Standardized values:} All features are scaled using \texttt{StandardScaler} to have mean 0 and variance 1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Recommendation Input}
\begin{itemize}
\item A single song name (e.g., \texttt{'Radiohead - Creep.wav'}) provided by the user.
\item The numeric feature vector corresponding to the provided song, extracted and scaled using the \texttt{StandardScaler}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model Output (Neural Network Predictions)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The model predicts a feature vector of the same shape as the input vector.
\item \textbf{Shape:} \((1, \text{num\_features})\), where each feature represents the model's prediction of the corresponding feature values for the input song.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Recommendation Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of recommended songs and their similarity scores:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recommended Songs:} Names of the most similar songs based on cosine similarity.
\item \textbf{Similarity Scores:} Cosine similarity values for the top recommendations.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Genre Prediction:}
To optimize the performance of our machine learning models for predicting song genres, we employed GridSearchCV to meticulously tune hyperparameters. This involved defining a grid of potential values for each hyperparameter and systematically evaluating their combinations using 5-fold cross-validation. The hyperparameter combination that yielded the lowest mean squared error (MSE) was selected as the optimal configuration for each model.

To gain deeper insights into the underlying structure of song genres, we employed a combination of clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. K-means clustering was utilized to partition the dataset into 13 clusters, corresponding to the predefined number of genres. This algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates cluster centroids to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. To optimize the clustering process, we set the number of clusters to 13 (n\_clusters=13), limited the maximum number of iterations to 300 (max\_iter=300), and ran the algorithm with 10 different initializations (n\_init=10) to improve convergence.

For a more flexible approach, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering was employed, allowing data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. This is particularly useful for genres that blend multiple styles. The key hyperparameters for FCM were set as follows: n\_clusters=13, m=2, max\_iter=150, and error=0.005.

To reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its essential characteristics, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied. This linear dimensionality reduction technique identifies the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the most variance in the data. The number of principal components to retain was determined using the elbow method or explained variance ratio.

To further explore the complex structure of the music dataset, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was utilized. This non-linear dimensionality reduction technique is particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional datasets, such as those in music. Key parameters for t-SNE included: n\_components=2, perplexity=30, learning\_rate=200, and n\_iter=1000.

Finally, an autoencoder was employed to learn a compressed representation of the input data. By training the autoencoder to reconstruct the original data from a lower-dimensional latent representation, we were able to extract the most salient features of the data. Key parameters for the autoencoder included: encoding\_dim, epochs, and batch\_size.

Despite some limitations in genre prediction accuracy, carefully selecting and tuning hyperparameters allowed us to gain valuable insights into the underlying structure and relationships between different music genres.

Our Results:

By combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we were able to effectively predict song genres and gain insights into the underlying structure of the dataset. Further exploration and refinement of these techniques can lead to even more accurate and informative models.

{\bf Recommending Songs:}
To create a robust music recommendation system, we explored a variety of machine learning models, including Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). For each model, we rigorously tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.

For each model, we employed grid search or randomized search cross-validation to explore a wide range of hyperparameter combinations. The specific hyperparameters tuned for each model are as follows:

Based on the performance metrics, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with the specified hyperparameters emerged as the top-performing model. It achieved the lowest MSE and MAE, along with the highest RÂ², indicating superior predictive accuracy and a strong fit to the data.

The SVM model, combined with cosine similarity for finding similar songs, was selected as the final recommendation system. This approach effectively leverages the strengths of SVM's powerful predictive capabilities and cosine similarity's ability to measure feature similarity.

For a given query song, the system:

Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from the song, such as tempo, rhythm, and harmonic content.

Model Prediction: Uses the trained SVM model to predict similar songs based on the extracted features.

Similarity Calculation: Calculates the cosine similarity between the query song's feature vector and the feature vectors of all other songs in the dataset. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a measure of their similarity in high-dimensional space.

Recommendation: Ranks the songs based on their cosine similarity to the query song and recommends the 5 top-ranked songs to the user.

% The proposed music recommendation system leverages a combination of techniques to provide accurate and personalized recommendations:

% {\bf Cosine Similarity:} Relevant audio features, such as tempo, rhythm, and harmonic content, are extracted from each song. Cosine similarity is calculated between the feature vectors of songs to identify similar ones. Songs with higher cosine similarity scores are recommended to the user.

% {\bf Neural Networks:} A neural network is trained on a large dataset of audio features and corresponding genre labels. The neural network learns to extract complex patterns and relationships between the features. To recommend songs, the features of a target song are input into the trained model, and predicted similarities with other songs in the dataset are obtained.

% {\bf k-Nearest Neighbors:} Euclidean distance is calculated between the feature vectors of songs. The k-nearest neighbors of a target song are identified based on the calculated distances. The k-nearest neighbors are recommended to the user.

% {\bf Decision Trees:} A decision tree is trained to classify songs based on their audio features. The decision tree learns a set of rules to predict the genre of a song. Songs from the same predicted genre are recommended to the user.

% {\bf Random Forests:} A random forest, an ensemble of decision trees, is trained to improve the accuracy and robustness of recommendations. The random forest combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to make a final recommendation.

%  By combining these techniques, the system aims to provide accurate and diverse music recommendations tailored to the user's preferences.

% {\bf Processing:} The dataset will undergo rigorous preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. Duplicate values, missing values, and outliers will be identified and addressed. Features will be normalized to a common scale to improve model performance. Additionally, feature engineering techniques will be explored to create new features or transform existing ones to enhance model accuracy. Finally, the dataset will be divided into training, validation, and testing sets to facilitate model development and evaluation.

% \subsection{Phase 2: model development}
% To provide accurate and personalized music recommendations, we will employ a hybrid approach combining content-based, collaborative filtering, and neural network techniques. Currently, we have implemented cosine similarity, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests for content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering will leverage user preferences and item similarities, using matrix factorization techniques like SVD. Additionally, neural networks can be explored to capture complex patterns in user behavior and music features, although simpler models might suffice for this task. To further enhance the recommendation system, we will explore techniques like intra-list similarity/diversity (ILS/ILD), genre consistency analysis, synthetic user data generation, and spectral graph analysis. Additionally, multi-genre prediction and PCA will be investigated to improve recommendation accuracy and efficiency. By combining these techniques and continuously refining our models, we aim to provide a robust and effective music recommendation system.

% \subsection{Phase 3: model evaluation and tuning}
% To evaluate the performance of our recommendation system, we will employ a combination of metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). We will experiment with different model architectures, such as neural networks, decision trees, and random forests, and tune their hyper parameters using techniques like grid search or random search. To address the cold start problem, we will employ a combination of content-based, collaborative filtering, and popularity-based recommendations. By rigorously evaluating and tuning our models, we aim to deliver a high-quality music recommendation system.

\section{Project Summary}
\label{headings}
{\bf Conclusion:}

This project delves into the construction of a robust music recommendation system, leveraging a diverse array of machine learning models and clustering techniques.

Genre Recommendation:

While clustering techniques like K-Means, PCA, and t-SNE were employed to identify genre clusters, accurate genre prediction proved to be a challenging task. The inherent ambiguity and overlap between genres often limited the effectiveness of automated classification methods.

Music Recommendation:

To address the core task of music recommendation, a variety of machine learning models were implemented and evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

Neural Networks: Demonstrated exceptional performance, with low MSE and MAE, and a high R-squared value.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): While effective, KNN generally exhibited higher error rates compared to more advanced models.

Decision Trees: Showed promising results, particularly in terms of interpretability.

Random Forest: Outperformed individual decision trees by leveraging ensemble learning techniques.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Achieved competitive performance, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Based on these performance metrics, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and SVM emerged as the top-performing models. They showcased their ability to capture complex patterns within the data, leading to accurate recommendations.

While this project provides a strong foundation for music recommendation systems, future work could focus on further refining hyperparameters, exploring advanced feature engineering, and potentially incorporating more sophisticated techniques like deep learning to enhance model performance and user experience. Additionally, addressing the challenges associated with accurate genre prediction remains an important area for future research.

% \section{Preparing PDF files}


% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''


% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.


% \begin{itemize}


% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.


% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%\newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%\newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%\newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.
